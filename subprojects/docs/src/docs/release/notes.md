### Signing Publications

The Signing plugin now supports signing all artifacts of a publication, e.g. when publishing artifacts to a Maven or Ivy repository.

    publishing {
        publications {
            mavenJava(MavenPublication) {
                from components.java
            }
        }
    }

    signing {
        sign publishing.publications
    }

## Promoted features

Promoted features are features that were incubating in previous versions of Gradle but are now supported and subject to backwards compatibility.
See the User guide section on the “[Feature Lifecycle](userguide/feature_lifecycle.html)” for more information.

The following are the features that have been promoted in this Gradle release.

## Fixed issues

## Deprecations

Features that have become superseded or irrelevant due to the natural evolution of Gradle become *deprecated*, and scheduled to be removed
in the next major Gradle version (Gradle 5.0). See the User guide section on the “[Feature Lifecycle](userguide/feature_lifecycle.html)” for more information.

The following are the newly deprecated items in this Gradle release. If you have concerns about a deprecation, please raise it via the [Gradle Forums](https://discuss.gradle.org).

<!--
### Example deprecation
-->

### Methods on `FileCollection`

- `FileCollection.add()` is now deprecated. Use `ConfigurableFileCollection.from()` instead. You can create a `ConfigurableFileCollection` via `Project.files()`.
- `FileCollection.stopExecutionIfEmpty()` is deprecated without a replacement. You can use `@SkipWhenEmpty` on a `FileCollection` property, or throw a `StopExecutionException` in your code manually instead.

### Method on `Signature`

`Signature.getToSignArtifact()` should have been an internal API and is now deprecated without a replacement.

## Potential breaking changes

<!--
### Example breaking change
-->

### TaskContainer.remove() now actually removes the task

TBD - previously this was broken, and plugins may accidentally rely on this behaviour.
