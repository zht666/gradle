## Promoted features

Promoted features are features that were incubating in previous versions of Gradle but are now supported and subject to backwards compatibility.
See the User guide section on the “[Feature Lifecycle](userguide/feature_lifecycle.html)” for more information.

The following are the features that have been promoted in this Gradle release.

## Fixed issues

## Deprecations

Features that have become superseded or irrelevant due to the natural evolution of Gradle become *deprecated*, and scheduled to be removed
in the next major Gradle version (Gradle 5.0). See the User guide section on the “[Feature Lifecycle](userguide/feature_lifecycle.html)” for more information.

The following are the newly deprecated items in this Gradle release. If you have concerns about a deprecation, please raise it via the [Gradle Forums](https://discuss.gradle.org).

<!--
### Example deprecation
-->

### Methods on `FileCollection`

- `FileCollection.add()` is now deprecated. Use `ConfigurableFileCollection.from()` instead. You can create a `ConfigurableFileCollection` via `Project.files()`.
- `FileCollection.stopExecutionIfEmpty()` is deprecated without a replacement. You can use `@SkipWhenEmpty` on a `FileCollection` property, or throw a `StopExecutionException` in your code manually instead.

### `SimpleFileCollection`

The internal `SimpleFileCollection` implementation of `FileCollection` has been deprecated.
You should use `Project.files()` instead.

## Potential breaking changes

<!--
### Example breaking change
-->

### TaskContainer.remove() now actually removes the task

TBD - previously this was broken, and plugins may accidentally rely on this behaviour.

### Signature.setFile() no longer changes the file to be published

Previously, `Signature.setFile()` could be used to replace the file used for publishing a `Signature`. However, the actual signature file was still being generated at its default location. Therefore, `Signature.setFile()` is now deprecated and will be removed in a future release.
